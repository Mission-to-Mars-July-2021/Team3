## Day 1 Retrospective

### What went well
Most of the work set was completed and we started to use tinker cad better.

### What didn't go well
Communication between the team as we didnt know who eachother were.


### What we will do more of tomorrow
Better use of git and comunication.

### What we will do less of tomorrow
less arkward silence.

## Day 2 Retrospective
We managed to get the rover moving in a straight line and stop at an exact point.
However turning is something we have not worked on yet.
The team has bonded more and is working better than before.

## Day 3 Retrospective
The tasks we were set were correct on the first rover test.
We worked out to get the rover going in a zig zag formation but we still need to work on getting it 
to go in a straight line for 10 seconds due to a list of errors we are still trying to trouble shoot.

## Day 4 Retrospective
